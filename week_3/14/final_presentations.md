# Final presentations

**This is it**!
After three weeks of intense focus on MI, you're ready to showcase what you've learned in your self-directed research projects.
We'll be starting final presentations on Zoom at **2:00PM PDT** and you're welcome to invite family and friends to this event! 🙌

Before then, please [edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/enze-chen/mi-book/blob/master/week_3/14/final_presentations.md) to add everything in square brackets: 

- Your emoji ([Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/))
- Presentation title
- Description
- A relevant figure that you created

Detailed instructions for how to do this can be found in Tuesday's mini-lesson on {doc}`../12/pull_requests`.

The following presenters are ordered alphabetically by first name.

To our guests: Check out the cool projects these students have made! 😎

**Description**: There is a growing demand for new high-k dielectric materials, which are instrumental to the functionality and miniaturization of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors. Of the thousands of materials and properties stored in the Materials Project database, only a subset contains information about the dielectric constants. We are able to design data-driven prediction models using supervised machine learning methods and cross-validation to estimate the dielectric constants for the remaining materials. By using a random forest regression model—presenting 39% relative error—we identify nearly 30 compounds that were not previously studied for this application, each with bandgaps in the insulator/dielectric range, a formation energy greater than the current industry standard SiO2, and large k values.  Further modeling and cost analysis will allow us to narrow our list of candidate materials.
