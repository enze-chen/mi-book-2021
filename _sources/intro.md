# Welcome! 👋

This digital, *interactive* textbook contains the curriculum for Module 2, where we will be using **materials informatics** (MI) techniques to study dielectric materials.
This website is intended to be a one-stop-shop where you can access all of the educational materials we'll be using.
We are super excited that you're here and we can't wait to embark on this learning journey with you! 🌱


```{attention}
This curriculum is still a work in progress and may be updated at any time. 
When that happens, things may or may not break.
Thank you for your patience and understanding.
```


## Navigating the curriculum

For the most part, you can use the navigation panel on the left to jump quickly between sections of this textbook. 
The `Day XX` pages will have a more detailed summary of all of the pages/activities for that day, which can be expanded by clicking the down chevron (⌄).
You can also navigate between adjacent pages using the navigation buttons at the bottom of each page.

Most of the curriculum will be accessible to everyone (the interactive exercises can be completed using Google Colaboratory instead of JupyterHub), although a few special features will require a UC Berkeley login (mostly to avoid spam).
If you want to view the source code of this textbook, you can hover over [Octocat](https://github.com/octocat) in the top-right corner and click {guilabel}`repository` or [click here](https://github.com/enze-chen/mi-book).



### Note on external links

The default behavior of Jupyter Book/Sphinx/HTML is to open all links _in the current tab_, so if you want to open external links in a new tab, you will have to `Ctrl+Click` the link or right click and select {guilabel}`Open link in new tab`.
Otherwise you'll have to keep clicking the ⬅ button in your browser to return to (and likely reload) the Jupyter Book.
