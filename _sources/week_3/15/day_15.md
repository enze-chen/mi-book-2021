# Day 15: Conclusions

It is the **final day** of Module 2, and while we're sad to be leaving you 😭, we're also **unbelievably proud** of you! 👏💯



## Goals for today

- Summarize everything we explored in the past three weeks.
- Reflect on your learning experience in this module.
- Discuss directions for future learning and look ahead to Module 3 (led by Sinéad).
- Wrap up the module with a final survey and some resources.

```{admonition} Milestone (last one, promise!)
:class: important
Please complete [the final survey](https://forms.gle/1yB81vKCfXx3BRNB9) for Module 2, if you don't finish it in today's morning session.
```



## Timing for today

- We will start the day with morning scrum on Zoom at 9:00AM.
- We will _most likely_ be done with everything before 11:00AM. 
Then you're free! 🎈
