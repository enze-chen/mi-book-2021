    "\n",
    "Thanks to the great minds behind [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), many of whom are here at UCB(!), we don't have to worry about installing any additional software on our personal computers.\n",
    "However, in order to take full advantage of all of the interactive features in this curriculum, we do ask that you sign up for online accounts on the following platforms.\n",
    "We will provide detailed instructions with screenshots in each section to help guide you.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The objective here is have these accounts *created and ready for use*; we'll provide more details on how we expect you to use these features later on at the appropriate times.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If you _already have_ a GitHub and/or Materials Project account, you **do not** have to create a new account and should just use your existing one on that platform.\n",

    "### GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform where people can store the code they write inside _repositories_ that can then be shared with the public.\n",
    "There are many good reasons for sharing code, including starting collaborations, showcasing your skills, broadening your impact, etc.\n",
    "This textbook, for example, is hosted on GitHub! 😉\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is loaded with cool features, and in this module, we will expose a few of those in the web user interface (UI). \n",
    "Therefore, we ask that you sign up for a GitHub account by going to: https://github.com/join, which will take you to a page that looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} ../assets/fig/preamble/github_join.png\n",

    "You can probably uncheck the \"Email preferences\" box.\n",
    "Verify that you're a human and then click {guilabel}`Create account`.\n",
    "You will have to also verify your email and go through a few more steps to set up your account (you can skip the personalization steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test GitHub account\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall from your previous classes or just common sense that it's a good idea to _conduct tests_ to make sure that your software (or in this case, our account) is behaving as expected.\n",
    "Hover over the [Octocat](https://github.com/octocat) button (the GitHub logo) in the top-right corner of this page and click \"💡`open issue`.\"\n",
    "If it successfully opens an issue for you, then your account is all set up and you can move on.\n",
    "There's no need to submit the issue (you can just close the tab), unless you actually have an issue.\n",

    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hypothesis](https://web.hypothes.is/) is a neat little tool that we'll be testing out to facilitate questions and discussions in context.\n",
    "It allows you to **highlight and annotate directly on this webpage** and the changes _will remain_ even if you close the browser.\n",
    "It will be our first time using this tool, and we hope it helps encourage participation and allows you to ask very targeted questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1\\) To sign up for a Hypothesis account, please go to: https://hypothes.is/signup, which will take you to a page that looks like:\n",

    "Check the first box, [probably] don't check the second box, and then click {guilabel}`Sign up`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2\\) Then, _using your UCB account_, open [this Google Drive file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Kk58b8DG8_QDMPbkUhnXA2NIAjfik47/view?usp=sharing) and find the link for our private Hypothesis user group that you should join. \n",
    "This will keep our comments a little more private and makes it easier for us to search for each other's comments (the public Hypothesis has over 1.5 million comments, lol).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Test Hypothesis account\n",
    "\n",
    "To test your Hypothesis account, add your response to the comment Enze left on the following question: Should Oski learn materials science?\n",

    "We recommend using the desktop client (it's highly likely you're already using this) and it should be as simple as clicking your profile picture in the top-right corner and the clicking {guilabel}`Check for Updates` (see image below).\n",

    "You should already have an account on our Slack workspace, and it doesn't really matter to us whether you use the browser version of Slack or the desktop app, as long as you're monitoring it for updates during working hours (you can set notifications in Preferences; see left panel below).\n",
    "If you do choose the desktop app, make sure you also understand how to update it (see right panel below).\n",
