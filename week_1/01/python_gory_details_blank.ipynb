    "After all, this whole internship is learning-driven and there are no grades.\n",

    "\n",
    "Arguably one of the most important properties in all of materials science is the [band gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_gap), which is a range of energies where no electronic states can exist.\n",
    "The band gap is formed in solids when many atoms are brought together into a close, periodic arrangement such that their orbitals hybridize into continuous energy bands where electrons are allowed to exist (see image in previous link).\n",
    "The lower band is called the **valence band** (electrons are bound to the atoms) and the upper band is called the **conduction band** (where electrons can flow to conduct current). \n",
    "The energy gap that separates these two bands (specifically, separating the valence band maximum (VBM) from the conduction band minimum (CBM)) is called the **band gap**, symbolized $E_g$.\n",
    "For more information, see Chapters 4.2-4.4 of the Kasap textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "![band gap](../../assets/fig/week_1/01/band_gap.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Electrons have to overcome this gap in order to become a conducting electron, and so the band gap determines the conductivity of a solid.\n",
    "Some _approximate_ ranges for the band gap energy are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $0 \\le E_g \\le 0.1\\ \\text{electronvolts (eV)}$, then the material is a **metal** (conductor), since electrons can very easily reach the conduction band. \n",
    "Example: copper (0.0 eV).\n",
    "- If $0.1 < E_g \\le\\ 4\\ \\text{eV}$, then the material is a **semiconductor**. \n",
    "Example: silicon (1.1. eV).\n",
    "- If $E_g > 4\\ \\text{eV}$, then the material is an **insulator**, since electrons will have a very hard time jumping from the valence band into the conduction band. \n",
    "In some (but not all) contexts, these materials are also referred to as **dielectrics**.\n",
    "Example: diamond (5 eV).\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a set of conditional statements that print out what type of material you have based on the value of `band_gap`.\n",

    "\n",
    "OK! We're one step closer to our goal, because now we've loaded the file into memory.\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "    - We also suggest adding blank lines in between sections of code that are doing different things, even within the same function body.\n",
    "- **Use descriptive names**. \n",
    "This is really key for you to understand what your variables and functions are doing, especially when you come back to the code the next day... or the next week... or the next year. 😁\n",
    "- **Practice decomposition**.\n",
    "By this we mean split your code into logical chunks, which may or may not go into helper functions, to help you organize your work.\n",
    "It's very easy with a language like Python to write _one giant script_ of hundreds of lines of code, which makes it very painful to read and debug (we've all been there).\n",
    "Decomposing your code makes it easier to test as you go and ensure sound logic.\n",
